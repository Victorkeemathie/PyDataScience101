AI - Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, learn, and problem-solve
AI encompasses a broad range of technologies, algorithms, and approaches that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence

Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed
It involves training models on data to identify patterns, make predictions, or take actions based on the available information

Supervised Machine Learning - Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data
In supervised learning, the input data (features) and the corresponding correct output (labels) are provided to the algorithm
The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the correct output for new, unseen input data
Examples of supervised learning algorithms include:

# 1. Linear Regression: Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. 
     It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the target variable and finds the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.

# 2. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. 
     It models the relationship between the input variables and the probability of a binary outcome. 
     It uses a logistic function to map the input features to the output probabilities, making it suitable for estimating the probability of a binary event.

# 3. Decision Trees: Decision trees are versatile supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification and regression tasks. 
     They create a tree-like model of decisions based on feature values to make predictions. 
     Each internal node represents a feature, and each leaf node represents a prediction or class label.

# 4. Random Forests: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. 
     Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of features. 
     Random forests provide improved accuracy and help mitigate overfitting.

# 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
     It finds an optimal hyperplane that separates the classes in a high-dimensional feature space. 
    SVM can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks using different kernel functions.

# 6. Naive Bayes Classifier: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. 
     It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label, which simplifies the computation. 
    Despite its simplicity, it often performs well on text classification and spam filtering tasks.

# 7. Neural Networks (Deep Learning): Neural networks, specifically deep learning, are powerful machine learning models inspired by the human brain's structure and function. 
     They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that can learn complex patterns and relationships in data. 
     Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image recognition, natural language processing, and other domains.

Unsupervised Machine Learning - Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns or structures in the input data without any labeled output. 
The goal is to discover hidden patterns, relationships, or groupings within the data. Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include:

# 8. Clustering Algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering): Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their features, without any predefined labels. 
     K-means is an iterative algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares. 
     Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting them based on distance or similarity measures.

# 9. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (Principal Component Analysis - PCA, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding - t-SNE): Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to reduce the number of features while preserving essential information.
     PCA finds orthogonal components that capture the most variance in the data. t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that maps high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space while preserving local similarities.

# 10. Association Rule Learning (Apriori Algorithm): Association rule learning is used to discover interesting relationships or associations between items in large datasets. 
      The Apriori algorithm is a popular algorithm that identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on support and confidence measures.

# 11. Anomaly Detection Algorithms (One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest): Anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual patterns or outliers in data. 
      One-Class SVM learns a model of normal data and detects deviations from it. 
      Isolation Forest separates anomalies by randomly partitioning data points and isolating them in shorter paths

Reinforcement Machine Learning: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment and takes actions to maximize rewards or minimize penalties. 
The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions and learns to optimize its decision-making process over time. Examples of reinforcement learning algorithms include:

# 12. Q-Learning: Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a value-based approach to learn optimal policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs). 
      It iteratively updates the Q-values for state-action pairs based on rewards and future Q-values.

# 13. Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Deep Q-Networks (DQN) combine deep learning with Q-learning for reinforcement learning tasks. 
      DQN uses a neural network to approximate the Q-values for state-action pairs. 
      It utilizes experience replay and a target network to stabilize the learning process.

# 14. Policy Gradient Methods: Policy gradient methods are reinforcement learning algorithms that directly learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, to maximize the expected cumulative reward. 
      They optimize the policy parameters using gradient ascent on the expected reward objective.

# 15. Actor-Critic Methods: Actor-Critic methods combine value-based and policy-based approaches in reinforcement learning.
      The actor represents the policy, and the critic estimates the value function. 
      The critic provides feedback to the actor, guiding the learning process to improve the policy.
